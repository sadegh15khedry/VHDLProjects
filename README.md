# VHDL Projects

This repository contains various VHDL projects showcasing digital logic circuits implemented using VHDL.

## Projects

1. [NAND NAND Logic](https://github.com/sadegh15khedry/VHDLProjects/tree/master/NAND_NAND_Logic): Implements a digital logic circuit using NAND gates.
2. [NAND OR Negation Logic](https://github.com/sadegh15khedry/VHDLProjects/tree/master/NAND_OR_Negation_Logic): Implements a digital logic circuit using NAND, OR, and NOT gates.
3. [XOR AND Gate Simulator](https://github.com/sadegh15khedry/VHDLProjects/tree/master/XOR_AND_Gate_Simulator): Simulates the behavior of XOR and AND gates.
4. [NAND Gate](https://github.com/sadegh15khedry/VHDLProjects/tree/master/nand): Implements a digital logic circuit using NAND gates.
5. [OR Gate](https://github.com/sadegh15khedry/VHDLProjects/tree/master/or): Implements a digital logic circuit using OR gates.

Each project contains VHDL code for the corresponding digital logic circuit along with testbench files to verify functionality.
