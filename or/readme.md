# OR Gate

This VHDL project implements a digital logic circuit that simulates the behavior of an OR gate.

## Description

The `or` module defines a digital logic circuit that performs the OR operation on two input signals and produces the output.

## File Structure

- `or.vhd`: Contains the VHDL code for the OR gate module.
- `testbench.vhd`: Contains the VHDL testbench code to simulate and verify the functionality of the OR gate.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing information about the project.

## Usage

To use this VHDL module, instantiate the `or` entity in your design hierarchy and connect the inputs and outputs as required.
