# XOR AND Gate Simulator

This VHDL project implements a digital logic circuit that simulates the behavior of an XOR-AND gate.

## Description

The `XOR_AND_Gate_Simulator` module defines a digital logic circuit that combines the XOR and AND operations to produce the final output.

## File Structure

- `XOR_AND_Gate_Simulator.vhd`: Contains the VHDL code for the XOR AND gate simulator module.
- `testbench.vhd`: Contains the VHDL testbench code to simulate and verify the functionality of the XOR AND gate simulator.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing information about the project.

## Usage

To use this VHDL module, instantiate the `XOR_AND_Gate_Simulator` entity in your design hierarchy and connect the inputs and outputs as required.
