# NAND OR Negation Logic

This VHDL project implements a digital logic circuit that performs the NAND of two inputs, performs the OR operation on the result, and then negates the final output.

## Description

The `NAND_OR_Negation_Logic` module defines a simple digital logic circuit that combines the NAND, OR, and negation operations to produce the final output.

## File Structure

- `NAND_OR_Negation_Logic.vhd`: Contains the VHDL code for the NAND OR Negation logic gate module.
- `testbench.vhd`: Contains the VHDL testbench code to simulate and verify the functionality of the NAND OR Negation logic gate.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing information about the project.

## Usage

To use this VHDL module, instantiate the `NAND_OR_Negation_Logic` entity in your design hierarchy and connect the inputs and outputs as required.
