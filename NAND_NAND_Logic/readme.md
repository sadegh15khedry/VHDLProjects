# NAND NAND Logic

This VHDL project implements a NAND-NAND logic gate using VHDL.

## Description

The `NAND_NAND_Logic` module defines a simple digital logic circuit that performs the NAND of two inputs and then performs the NAND of the result with a third input.

## File Structure

- `NAND_NAND_Logic.vhd`: Contains the VHDL code for the NAND NAND logic gate module.
- `testbench.vhd`: Contains the VHDL testbench code to simulate and verify the functionality of the NAND NAND logic gate.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing information about the project.

## Usage

To use this VHDL module, instantiate the `NAND_NAND_Logic` entity in your design hierarchy and connect the inputs and outputs as required.
