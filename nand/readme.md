# NAND Gate

This VHDL project implements a digital logic circuit that simulates the behavior of a NAND gate.

## Description

The `nand` module defines a digital logic circuit that performs the NAND operation on two input signals and produces the output.

## File Structure

- `nand.vhd`: Contains the VHDL code for the NAND gate module.
- `testbench.vhd`: Contains the VHDL testbench code to simulate and verify the functionality of the NAND gate.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing information about the project.

## Usage

To use this VHDL module, instantiate the `nand` entity in your design hierarchy and connect the inputs and outputs as required.
